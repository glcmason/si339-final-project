            Hi, my name is Grace Lucille Mason! I am a junior studying User Experience and Chinese language at the University of Michigan.
            I am passionate about designing user friendly interfaces that prioritize accessibility. I specifically enjoy designing automative interfaces. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My design journey begins from a young age, where I first began drawing. I continued to progress through my skills and
            during highschool I attended Interlochen Summer Arts Camp as an advanced painter. I sold a few commissions and then began
            college at the University of Michigan. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I orginally was studying computer science with an art minor, however I didn't fully enjoy cs or art classes. Then I learned
            about UofM's School of Information and UX Major and promptly applied.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In UMSI, I found an immense passion for UX Design and Human Computer Interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my freetime I like to paint and draw, currently I have been inspired by northern Michigan's picturesque scenary. 
            I also have a huge passion for music, specifically jazz and blues as I attended Interlochen not only for painting, 
            but for jazz as well. (Fun fact, my Grace Lucille is my first name, Lucille comes from the blues musician
            B.B. King's guitar named Lucille.)
